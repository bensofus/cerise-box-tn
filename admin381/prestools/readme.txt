** Getting started **
Extract the zip. Then move all files to a subdirectory under your admin folder. Access them in your browser like "www.myshop.com/myadmin/myfolder/order-edit.php".
The first time you will automatically be redirected to "login1.php" for the login. The default username is "demo@demo.com". The default password is "opensecret". 

Note that this is not a Prestashop module so you cannot load it as a module!

Feedback on the script is always welcome. Many of its features originate in user questions and suggestions.

** Security ** 
The default username and password are meant for test purposes. You should change them inside the file "settings1.php".

In addition you should specify which ip addresses are allowed to access the script. Notice that for localhost this can be either "127.0.0.1" (IPv4) or "::1" (IPv6). With IPv4 you can use wildchars ("*") in the IP addresses.
Your ip address is visible in the login screen so you can copy the address.

As long as you haven't set your own password and ip address(es) you will be nagged with a popup during login.
